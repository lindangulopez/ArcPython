ArcGIS Model Builder Scripts 

ArcGIS's Model Builder is used for MODEL CREATION in ArcGIS, the Final Product can be shared in its Native Form, as an ArcGIS Tool or as a Python Script. Both options allow for Workflow Transparency, Collaboration and Efficiency. There are hundreds of GIS tools, these tools do basic mathematical and logical operations (such as copy and clip and join with conditions) on geographic data, such as features and tables and rasters. Spatial Analysis is not only for terrain analysis - any point data with corresponding geo-coordinates can me manipulated in ArcGIS for analytics from density mapping to suitability modeling to image classification. 

Even if you're just using a model it is necessary to have an understanding of how environment & attribution affect outcomes and set the correct symbology to render desired information at the appropriate scale. These models were created on ArcGIS Model Builder & Saved as Python Scripts,

WATCH OUT: environment & attribution affects outcomes so you will have to adapt them to your needs , how would you change them!?
