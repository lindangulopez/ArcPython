************************** Initial Data Assessment ***************************
Making sure there are enough weighted features for analysis....
- There are 3105 valid input features.
Evaluating the Analysis Field values....
- SNAPRATE Properties:
        Min:       0.0048
        Max:       0.5763
        Mean:      0.1393
        Std. Dev.: 0.0702
Looking for locational outliers....
- There were 64 outlier locations; these will not be used to compute the optimal fixed distance band.
***************************** Scale of Analysis ******************************
Looking for an optimal scale of analysis by assessing the intensity of clustering at increasing distances....
- No optimal distance was found using this method.
Determining an optimal distance using the spatial distribution of features....
- The optimal fixed distance band is based on the average distance to 30 nearest neighbors: 151156.0000 Meters
***************************** Hot Spot Analysis ******************************
Finding statistically significant clusters of high and low SNAPRATE values....
- There are 2131 output features statistically significant based on an FDR correction for multiple testing and spatial dependence.
- 3.3% of features had less than 8 neighbors based on the distance band of 151156.0000 Meters
*********************************** Output ***********************************
Creating output feature class: D:\GIS\PatternDetection_SpaceTime\SNAPHotSpots.shp
- Red output features represent hot spots where high SNAPRATE values cluster.
- Blue output features represent cold spots where low SNAPRATE values cluster.
