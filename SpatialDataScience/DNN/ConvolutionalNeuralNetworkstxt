Deep learning

When working with large collections of imagery, at some point machine learning starts to plateau, and this is really 
where deep learning brings a lot of value. It's based on neural networks that contain code structures that are stored 
as layers. When applied to spatial information imagery, the work tends to fall into four main categories: (i) object 
detection, (ii) instance segmentation, (iii) image classification, and (iv) pixel classification.

Images are analyzed as pixels, which are the input image. They are multiplied by the filter in groups and combined to 
create a new pixel value in the activation map.  The filter slides, or convolves, over the entire input image and creates
an activation map output.  Convolutional neural networks are used as filters, for image analysis, each neuron looks for 
a specific trait, activating a different part of the image.

For example starting with simple features, such as lines or edges, and progressing to abstract combinations of patterns 
as the network gets deeper. As the model is trained, it iterates between running the training examples through the network 
of filters, generating a prediction, comparing the predicted value to the actual value, then adjusting the filters slightly
to get the predicted value closer to the actual value.
