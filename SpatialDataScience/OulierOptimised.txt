************************** Initial Data Assessment ***************************
Making sure there are enough weighted features for analysis....
- There are 3105 valid input features.
Evaluating the Analysis Field values....
- SNAPRATE Properties:
        Min:       0.0048
        Max:       0.5763
        Mean:      0.1393
        Std. Dev.: 0.0702
Looking for locational outliers....
- There were 64 outlier locations; these will not be used to compute the optimal fixed distance band.
***************************** Scale of Analysis ******************************
- The Neighborhood Distance used was 75 Kilometers.
************************* Optimized Outlier Analysis *************************
Creating the random reference distribution with 499 permutations....
Finding statistically significant outliers of high and low SNAPRATE values....
- There are 1041 output features statistically significant based on an FDR correction for multiple testing and spatial dependence.
- There are 34 statistically significant high outlier features.
- There are 32 statistically significant low outlier features.
- There are 540 features part of statistically significant low clusters.
- There are 435 features part of statistically significant high clusters
- 38% of features had less than 8 neighbors based on the distance band of 75 Kilometers
*********************************** Output ***********************************
- Pink output features are part of a cluster of high SNAPRATE values.
- Light Blue output features are part of a cluster of low SNAPRATE values.
- Red output features represent high outliers within a cluster of low SNAPRATE values..
- Blue output features represent low outliers within a cluster of high SNAPRATE values.
